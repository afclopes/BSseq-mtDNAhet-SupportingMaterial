# BSseq-mtDNAhet-SupportingMaterial

This repository was created to carry supporting information that was used when creating the repository called 'BSseq-mtDNAhet'. Consider it the labbook that acompanied the main experiments ('BSseq-mtDNAhet'). Here you will find Rmarkdown files with notes and links to where information was taken from, and also Colab notebooks with work done in python which was mostly preliminary to the coding done on the cluster.
